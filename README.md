# ABED-2x2-rep (Agent-Based Evolutionary Dynamics in 2x2 repeated games)
ABED-2x2-rep is a modeling framework designed to simulate the evolution of a population of agents who play a symmetric 2x2 repeated game and, from time to time, are given the opportunity to revise their strategy.

ABED-2x2-rep is implemented in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
